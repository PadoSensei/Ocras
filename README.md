<h2>  Quick Demo </h2>

To quickly see what our app is about, you can use a QR code scanner to scan the code below and this will take you to the Customer Ordering page. 
For demonstration purposes, this QR code will display a hardcoded menu. 
From here, you can place an order into the system, then follow the order on the Kitchen and MGMT pages. 

< we stick in the QR CODE here>

<h2>  Full Demo </h2>

For a more complete demo, follow this link to be taken to the Admin screen of our app. Here, a user can input their restaurant details, menu options and the number of tables in their restaurant. 
Once all the details are entered, the app will generate a QR code for each table in the restaurant. Each scanned QR code will take the scanner to the restaurant's Customer Page and an order can be placed and tracked, like in the Quick Demo above.
